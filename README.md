# Exploiting-Windows-XP-In-a-close-lab-environment
This project aims to learn different types of vulnerability that exists in windows XP as a way to deepen understanding of how could a system vulnerabilities  be exploited

**Objectives**
- Gather data on vulnerabiliies in the system with active reconnaissance sance techniques.
- Deepen Understanding of CVSS scores with vulnerability analysis
- Use public exploits to exploit the weakness of a system and evaluate the effect on a system.

**How this works**
I have 4 VM's configured for this project: 1) Kali linux 2) Metasploitable 3) Windows 10 4) Microsoft Windows XP Professional (32-bit)
Windows 10 is out of the picture for this project, and will be a part of other projects. 

**VM/Lab Environment**

Attack environment: 
1. Kali Linux
2. Metasploitable
Tools:

VM to be exploited: Microsoft Windows XP Professional (32-bit)


**Scanning Methodology:**
1. Nessus

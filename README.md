# Exploiting-Windows-XP-In-a-close-lab-environment
This project aims to learn different types of vulnerability that exists in windows XP as a way to deepen understanding of how could a system vulnerabilities  be exploited

**Objectives**
- Gather data on vulnerabiliies in the system with active reconnaissance sance techniques.
- Deepen Understanding of CVSS scores with vulnerability analysis
- Use public exploits to exploit the weakness of a system and evaluate the effect on a system.

**How this works**
I have 4 VM's configured for this project: 1) Kali linux 2) Metasploitable 3) Windows 10 4) Microsoft Windows XP Professional (32-bit)
Windows 10 is out of the picture for this project, and will be a part of other projects. 

**VM/Lab Environment**

Attack environment: 
1. Kali Linux
2. Metasploitable
Tools:

**Vulnerable Device Information:**
Version: Windows XP Professional ( 32 bit )
Service Pack : 2

**Methodology:**
1. Nmap scan Summary | More Detailed Notes: Scanning/NmapScan.md
2. Picking a Vulnerability type
3. Exploting the System using the chosen vulnerability
4. Evaluate the effect that the vulnerability caused in the system
5. Asses and Evaluate CVSS score and improve understanding
6. Make a report about the action taken
7. Go to step 1 
   
**Current Progress**
- [x] Organizing & Planning
- [x] Setting up Testing environment
- [ ] Scanning the target
- [ ] Reports
- [ ] Explotation
- [ ] Post exploitation Analysis
